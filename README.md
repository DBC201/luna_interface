# luna_interface
A very simple website interface for [Luna](https://github.com/DBC201/Luna)

This website shows the price changes in the first minute when a coin is listed on Binance.
It is fully automatic working together with [Luna's listing log](https://github.com/DBC201/Luna/tree/master/luna_scripts/listing_log).
It also has an [email sender](https://github.com/DBC201/Luna/tree/master/luna_scripts/listing_mail) which
[scrapes the Binance announcement page](https://github.com/DBC201/Luna/blob/master/luna_modules/binance/BinanceAnnouncementScrape.py) 
and emails the added emails automatically.
